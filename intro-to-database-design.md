#Intro to Database Design

1. Look at the following database tables. Identify the candidate key i.e. the minimal columns that can serve as a primary key.

 | student_id | mod_code | mark |
 |------------|----------|------|
 | u1811563   | cft2111  | 67   |
 | u1893221   | cit2318  | 55   |
 | u1811563   | cip2225  | 87   |
 | u1952004   | cft2111  | 62   |


 | suit   | value | played |

 | hearts | Ace   | true   |
 | clubs  | 8     | false  |
 | spades | King  | true   |
 | club   | 3     | true   |

2. Consider the following scenarios

* NASA have approached you to build a web application that will allow users to search for information about the history of space missions. You can see info about Space Missions here - http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/solarsystem/space_missions. How could you model the topic of space missions. Create a class diagram that identifies relevant classes and attributes. 

* You have been approached by a major supermarket to develop a website that features recipes by famous chefs using ingredients that can be bought at the supermarket. Create a class diagram that identifies relevant classes and attributes.
